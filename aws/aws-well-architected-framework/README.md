# AWS Well-Architected Framework: Overview

AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. Built around six pillars:

1. **Operational excellence**
2. **Security**
3. **Reliability**
4. **Performance efficiency**
5. **Cost optimization**
6. **Sustainability**

AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

**Summary of guidelines:**

- Stop guessing your capacity needs, use Auto-Scaling Groups or ECS Tasks or EKS instead
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier (for e.g. CloudFormation template)
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days
  - Simulate applications (e.g. sale days)
