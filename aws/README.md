# [Modular Packages for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

In v3 of AWS SDK for JavaScript, modularity was introduced by breaking the JavaScript SDK core into multiple packages and publishing each service as its own package. These packages are published under `@aws-sdk/` scope on NPM to make it easy to identify packages that are part of the official AWS SDK for JavaScript.
