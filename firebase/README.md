# What is Firebase?

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas) platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

Simply put, Firebase is a swiss army knife of backend services. You can do many things easily, but if you use without considering the future, especially scale, you might get yourself cut by the same knife.

However, if you are a startup and looking to go-to-market quickly, Firebase is a great choice to create rapid prototypes by taking out the hassle out of building the backend for applications.
